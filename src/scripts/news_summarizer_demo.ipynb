            "value": "     ‘For every 1C increase in temperature, there is roughly a 1% increase in the risk of suicide,’ says Neil Jennings of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London\n\n    Stress of environmental degradation, displacement, rising temperatures, or worsening air quality can ‘slowly wear away at people’s psychological well-being,’ says Dorina Cadar, a leading researcher in neuroepidemiology and dementia\n    There is growing evidence of climate anxiety being ‘especially common among younger people and those who feel powerless in the face of global environmental changes,’ says Cadar\n\nISTANBUL\n\nAs the world grapples with raging wildfires, soaring temperatures, and deadly floods, experts are raising alarms over a less visible crisis: the profound impact of climate change on mental health.\n\nAll continents are facing devastating floods, wildfires, extreme heat waves, and other climate disasters, and the psychological toll for the billions impacted is intensifying.\n\n“Climate change can have a profound effect on mental health through both direct and indirect pathways,” Dorina Cadar, a leading researcher in neuroepidemiology and dementia, told Anadolu.\n\nPeople directly exposed to extreme weather events such as floods, wildfires, hurricanes, or heat waves often experience acute stress and trauma, which can manifest as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), she explained.\n\nClimate expert Neil Jennings also highlighted the historic neglect of the connection between climate change and mental health.\n\n“Climate change is having an impact on health-related outcomes … (in) both physical health and mental health,” Jennings, who is associated with the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, told Anadolu.\n\nBut mental health “historically has received less attention than physical health,” he said.\n\n\nMood changes to suicide risks\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures have scorched large parts of the Mediterranean, Europe, Asia, the US, and the Middle East in recent weeks, with forecasters warning of prolonged heat waves.\n\n“Heat waves are often overlooked in terms of mental health research, yet these have been linked to changes in mood, increased aggression, disturbed sleep, and a rise in hospital admissions for people with existing mental health conditions,” said Cadar, director of the Cognitive Epidemiology, Dementia, and Ageing Research (CEDAR) lab at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School.\n\nAlong with these effects, Jennings pointed out that extreme heat even leads to elevated suicide risk. “We know that for every 1C increase in temperature, there is roughly a 1% increase in the risk of suicide,” he warned.\n\nPast research has found that every 1C increase in monthly average temperature led to a 2.2% spike in mental health-related deaths, while increases in relative humidity also pushed up suicide rates.\n\nJennings emphasized that certain occupational groups, such as outdoor laborers, construction workers, and farmers, face additional mental health risks.\n\nFarmers, for instance, often experience significant psychological stress due to crop losses from extreme heat, floods, and wildfires, he added.\n\nOther extreme weather events also take a heavy toll on mental health. Floods and hurricanes, for instance, often trigger PTSD symptoms long after the events have passed.\n\n“The emotional shock of losing one’s home or being displaced, combined with the slow and difficult recovery process, can leave a lasting psychological impact,” said Cadar.\n\n“Studies have reported PTSD rates as high as 30% in flood-affected populations.”\n\nWildfires, too, are associated with increased anxiety, depression, and substance use, especially among evacuees and first responders. The unpredictability and rapid spread of wildfires can leave communities feeling powerless and traumatized.\n\nWhile droughts might seem less dramatic, she added, they also lead to chronic stress, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts, particularly among farming communities whose livelihoods depend on climate-sensitive environments.\n\n\nWho is most vulnerable?\n\nAlthough climate-related mental illnesses can affect anyone, research clearly shows that certain groups are especially vulnerable.\n\nCadar noted that older adults, particularly those with dementia or cardiovascular disease, are at high risk, as they may struggle to regulate body temperature or access assistance during heat waves.\n\nPeople with pre-existing mental illnesses are also vulnerable, as they may have difficulty recognizing or responding to early signs of heat-related distress, she said.\n\nLow-income individuals who lack access to cooling systems, live in poorly insulated housing, or work outdoors face additional risks.\n\nChildren and adolescents, who are more sensitive to environmental changes and disruptions, can also suffer from emotional distress, Cadar added.\n\nUrban populations, she explained, are particularly vulnerable due to the “urban heat island” effect, where dense infrastructure and limited green spaces lead to higher temperatures in cities.\n\n“High temperatures can worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, and may even increase the risk of suicide,” Cadar reiterated.\n\n“This is partly because heat affects the body’s ability to regulate stress and maintain mood balance, but also because many psychiatric medications interfere with the body’s natural cooling processes, making people more vulnerable to heat-related illness.”\n\nJennings agreed, noting that individuals with existing mental health conditions are two to three times more likely to die during extreme weather events.\n\n“People with certain conditions, such as schizophrenia, who take medications like lithium, that can impair their ability to regulate body temperature,” he explained.\n\nDuring a severe heat dome event in North America in 2021, “about 8% of the people who died had schizophrenia,” he added.\n\n\nInequality amplifies mental health burden\n\nExperts emphasize that climate change disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic groups, exacerbating mental health inequalities.\n\n“The long-term stress of living with environmental degradation, the threat of losing homes or suffering severe damage, rising temperatures, or worsening air quality can slowly wear away at people’s psychological well-being,” said Cadar.\n\nShe highlighted growing evidence of “climate anxiety,” also known as “eco-anxiety,” characterized by chronic fear or distress over the future of the planet.\n\n“This is especially common among younger people and those who feel powerless in the face of global environmental changes,” she explained.\n\nMoreover, climate change indirectly impacts mental health by disrupting social and economic structures, including housing, health care, farming, and agriculture.\n\n“When people lose their livelihoods … are forced to relocate, or feel disconnected from their communities or natural environment, their mental health can suffer,” Cadar said.\n\n“People in disadvantaged or marginalized groups are often hit hardest, as they have fewer resources to adapt and recover.”"

Floods and hurricanes, for instance, often trigger PTSD symptoms long after the events have passed.\n\n“The emotional shock of losing one’s home or being displaced, combined with the slow and difficult recovery process, can leave a lasting psychological impact,” said Cadar.\n\n“Studies have reported PTSD rates as high as 30% in flood-affected populations.”\n\nWildfires, too, are associated with increased anxiety, depression, and substance use, especially among evacuees and first responders. The unpredictability and rapid spread of wildfires can leave communities feeling powerless and traumatized.\n\nWhile droughts might seem less dramatic, she added, they also lead to chronic stress, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts, particularly among farming communities whose livelihoods depend on climate-sensitive environments.\n\n\nWho is most vulnerable?\n\nAlthough climate-related mental illnesses can affect anyone, research clearly shows that certain groups are especially vulnerable.\n\nCadar noted that older adults, particularly those with dementia or cardiovascular disease, are at high risk, as they may struggle to regulate body temperature or access assistance during heat waves.\n\nPeople with pre-existing mental illnesses are also vulnerable, as they may have difficulty recognizing or responding to early signs of heat-related distress, she said.\n\nLow-income individuals who lack access to cooling systems, live in poorly insulated housing, or work outdoors face additional risks.\n\nChildren and adolescents, who are more sensitive to environmental changes and disruptions, can also suffer from emotional distress, Cadar added.\n\nUrban populations, she explained, are particularly vulnerable due to the “urban heat island” effect, where dense infrastructure and limited green spaces lead to higher temperatures in cities.\n\n“High temperatures can worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders, and may even increase the risk of suicide,” Cadar reiterated.\n\n“This is partly because heat affects the body’s ability to regulate stress and maintain mood balance, but also because many psychiatric medications interfere with the body’s natural cooling processes, making people more vulnerable to heat-related illness.”\n\nJennings agreed, noting that individuals with existing mental health conditions are two to three times more likely to die during extreme weather events.\n\n“People with certain conditions, such as schizophrenia, who take medications like lithium, that can impair their ability to regulate body temperature,” he explained.\n\nDuring a severe heat dome event in North America in 2021, “about 8% of the people who died had schizophrenia,” he added.\n\n\nInequality amplifies mental health burden\n\nExperts emphasize that climate change disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic groups, exacerbating mental health inequalities.\n\n“The long-term stress of living with environmental degradation, the threat of losing homes or suffering severe damage, rising temperatures, or worsening air quality can slowly wear away at people’s psychological well-being,” said Cadar.\n\nShe highlighted growing evidence of “climate anxiety,” also known as “eco-anxiety,” characterized by chronic fear or distress over the future of the planet.\n\n“This is especially common among younger people and those who feel powerless in the face of global environmental changes,” she explained.\n\nMoreover, climate change indirectly impacts mental health by disrupting social and economic structures, including housing, health care, farming, and agriculture.\n\n“When people lose their livelihoods … are forced to relocate, or feel disconnected from their communities or natural environment, their mental health can suffer,” Cadar said.\n\n“People in disadvantaged or marginalized groups are often hit hardest, as they have fewer resources to adapt and recover.”"

        "Türkiye has the potential to become a regional leader by demonstrating how bold climate action can drive economic growth, strengthen energy security, and attract global investment, according to the UN’s top climate official.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speaking to Anadolu about his visit to Türkiye this week, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), praised the country’s clean energy progress, stressing that it is well-positioned for further steps through a new national climate plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Türkiye can lead by example, especially within the region, by showing how climate targets go hand-in-hand with economic growth,” Stiell said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Türkiye has unique advantages – huge capacity for wind and solar, vibrant small and medium enterprises, and a young population. These advantages, combined with stronger targets, are a recipe for success.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Stiell urged Türkiye to build on its current clean energy momentum and submit an enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) this year.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In 2024, Türkiye was in the top 10 countries with the largest absolute solar capacity additions,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A more ambitious NDC, a new national climate plan and targets, would send a strong signal to global investors that Türkiye is committed to accelerating the transformation in its energy and power sectors – going further and faster to meet rising demand.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He noted that stronger climate commitments could yield wide-ranging benefits: “It can save billions of dollars through reduced fossil fuel imports, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, all while reducing its current account deficit, which will have very positive implications for the economy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In 2023, Türkiye attracted $1.4 billion for non-hydro renewables. Solar, wind, and hydrogen are all poised to take off.”\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Stiell, the submission of a strengthened NDC is “a real opportunity” to boost energy independence and create lasting economic growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transition leadership and a just future\n",
        "\n",
        "Stiell highlighted the global shift towards clean energy and said countries that invest early are already seeing significant returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Germany’s energy transition created a large clean energy workforce. Morocco’s solar investments positioned it as a regional energy leader,” he said. “India wants to become a solar superpower. Nigeria sees huge opportunities across society to reduce dependence on diesel generators.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He also emphasized the central role of the private sector.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The private sector’s role is particularly important, and the returns for the private sector stand to be significant, across every major economy,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "A just transition must also remain a priority: “A just transition plan, including retraining and investment in affected communities, is also essential. Türkiye can lead the world in ensuring no worker or community associated with the fossil fuel industry is left behind.”\n",
        "\n",
        "On whether tougher climate targets pose an economic burden, Stiell pointed to the importance of international cooperation and financial mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "“International climate finance, technology partnerships, and regional cooperation are key. Access to EU climate-linked funding can help reduce upfront transition costs. Clear policy frameworks and stronger NDCs can also unlock investment from the private sector by improving market confidence and reducing regulatory risk,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "He also pointed to the role of Türkiye’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) in supporting competitiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other countries, similar carbon pricing mechanisms have generated revenues that are reinvested to fund clean energy efforts, he noted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business readiness and climate resilience\n",
        "\n",
        "During his two-day visit to Türkiye that wrapped up Wednesday, Stiell met with Turkish civil society and business leaders, noting strong enthusiasm and readiness to contribute to the country’s green transition.\n",
        "\n",
        "“On my trip I’ve heard how clear policies and climate ambition can support national growth, drive innovation, and create export opportunities. The private sector in this country is dynamic. Early action gives companies a competitive edge in global markets,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And it isn’t just about existing energy – Turkish companies have all the tools to become a leader in new forms of green technology and manufacturing.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Stiell also stressed the importance of policymaking that includes civil society, especially youth.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Their representation in climate action and policymaking will ensure NDCs are well-aligned with national and local needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society, including women, youth, and poorer people, participate and benefit from the transition,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stronger climate targets, he added, must also focus on adaptation and resilience.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Stronger NDCs help direct investment not only into emissions reduction but also into building resilience. Türkiye is already facing serious climate risks, including wildfires and water scarcity,” he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A well-designed national climate plan can support early warning systems, disaster risk reduction, drought and wildfire management, and climate-resilient infrastructure, which are essential for safeguarding hard-won economic gains and achieving long-term development targets.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Stiell welcomed Türkiye’s progress on a national adaptation strategy and said sharing lessons with other nations will be key.\n",
